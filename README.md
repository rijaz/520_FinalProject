Exploring Gender Bias in News Headlines

## Problem or Question

Single statement describing either the project you are tackling with this project or the research question you are planning on answering. 

This research aims to analyze the headline texts and classify them on how biased they are in terms of gender. Our hypothesis is that there are more headlines leaning toward males than females.

## Data

Two to four bullet points describing the data you are using and the method you plan on using.

- We will be using the Newscatcher API (https://newscatcherapi.com/) that is available as a Python package to gather data for our project. 
- Data will include the following relevant information:
      1. Title: The title of the article
      2. Author: The author of the article
      3. Published date: Publication date and time of the article 
      4. Link: A link to the article
      5. Excerpt: Short summary of the article provided by the publisher
      6. Summary: Contents of the article
- We will sort the news articles according to their topic using classification then utilize the prevalence of pronouns and gendered words (i.e. congresswoman, actress) as a stand-in for gender to classify male vs. female.
- Using sentiment analysis, we will compare the aforementioned male and female headlines to analyze their differences. 


## Importance

Two to four bullet points describing why this project matters and what the potential implications are of the findings are.

- Gender equality is a sign of a healthy society, identifying gender bias in a renowned newspaper will give us an idea of how society is shown by the editors with regard to gender.
- According to a recent report by the Global Media Monitoring Project, women make up 24% of news sources (i.e. people seen, heard, or read about in broadcast and print media).
- Given the scant representation of women in media, our exploration hopes to reveal whether when women do appear in the news, is their gender more heavily stressed than their male counterparts. 
- This research could be applied or used to identify gender bias in other sources of information (e.g. other newspapers, magazines, etc.)
- Additionally, we hope that this research can serve a starting point to explore further bias research outside the gender binary.
